📊 Remote Work & Productivity Analysis – Python Mini Project

This project transforms MBA research into a hands-on Python-based analysis of the **impact of remote work on employee productivity and work-life balance**. Using simulated survey data, we apply real analytics techniques to explore key trends and relationships.

🎯 Objective

To explore how factors like **flexibility**, **organizational support**, and **communication** influence employee **productivity** and **work-life balance** in remote or hybrid work setups.


📌 Key Features

* 📁 Simulated dataset of 100 employees based on research hypothesis
* 📊 Data analysis using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
* 📈 Regression modeling using **Statsmodels** to predict productivity
* 🔥 Visuals: scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps
* 🧠 Real-world application of business analytics concepts in Python

🧪 Tools Used

* Python 3
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Statsmodels (for OLS regression)
